Though the remuneration rights model would likely cost billions of dollars to transition to and implement, much of this would be offset thanks to the benefits of the new system. While a feasibility study should cost such a transition fully, the sponsors of the 2011 [MIPF](/proposals-summary/MIPF.md) bill estimated that the scheme would reduce the cost of drugs in the US by more than 250 billion dollars.[^1] This would more than cover the proposed $80 billion cost to implement the fund.
