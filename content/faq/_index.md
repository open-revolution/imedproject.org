## Is the fund fixed?
Yes, the fund would have a fixed disbursable pool available for innovation funding each year. The amount would be based on either the current level of private spending on pharmaceutical R&D or at a set percentage of GDP for each participating government to contribute.
## Where would the money come from?
We already have substantial sources of funding for medicines in the form of healthcare budgets, divided amongst direct grant and indirect funding through drug purchases. This funding comes from taxpayers, employers and insurers.
## How do innovators get paid?  How is the money divided between people?
Innovators apply for a remuneration right, the same way they do for patent today and receive a remuneration right entitling them to a payment from the fund reflecting the health impact of their innovation (instead of a monopoly right).
## What is the difference with prize fund and market entry reward, ect.?
The remuneration right fund will have a focus on health impact (much like prizes and rewards) but it will entitle the innovator to several years of remuneration, like a patent, except that the information will be open for other innovators to build upon.
## What is the benefit of RR for governments?
Remuneration rights will optimise innovation towards health impact: ensuring the most relevant diseases are targeted while also drive healthcare costs down.  
## If it is health impact based, what about rare diseases?
Heath impact will be measured in  quality-adjusted life years Quality-Adjusted Life Year (QALY) or Disability-Adjusted Life Year (DALY) which are used by institutions like the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) and the WHO. The measure of health impact will be adjusted to ensure fair repartition of capitals (e.g. orphan diseases).
## Who is already already using a similar model?
 Australian government (e.g. Hep C deal) and companies such as Spotify, already use this model. Read more of the similarities between remuneration rights and Spotify in [details here](/blog/spotify-model.md).
