If you include your health in your wealth then the answer is yes: millions more people, especially poorer people will have access to medicines that can heal them. Today it is common for medicines to cost tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of dollars for a course of treatment when the medicines themselves only cost a tens or hundreds of dollars to make with the result that only the rich can afford them.

If you are just talking about monetary wealth: the answer is less clearcut. The current proposal may lead to payout to innovators that is more closely linked to health impact (rather than e.g. marketing) which could be more equal.
