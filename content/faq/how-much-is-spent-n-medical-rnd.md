According to one estimate, ‘'Total global investments in health R&D (both public and private sector) in 2009 reached 240 billion dollars (US). Of the US$214 billion invested in high-income countries, 60% of health R&D investments came from the business sector, 30% from the public sector, and about 10% from other sources (including private non-profit organisations). Only about 1% of all health R&D investments were allocated to neglected diseases in 2010.[^1]
