Yes. Although profits would no longer be tied directly to health impact instead of sales, there would be an incentive to market effectively. Under the remuneration rights, competing manufacturers would use marketing to increase their market share (instead of awarding monopoly and exclusive marketing rights to innovators as it is the case under the current patent system). Ultimately, marketing undertaken by manufacturers would increase and with it the use - and therefore the health impact - of innovations.
