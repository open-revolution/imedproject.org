Shareholders continue to receive profits from pharmaceutical companies and Investors get returns from R&D that delivers health impact at a level at least equal to what it is today.

Pharmaceutical companies would remain profitable businesses, but their profits would be tied to health impact rather than to pure sales. Shareholders would still receive these profits which would be at least equal (or superior) to today. Furthermore, the structure of the remuneration rights fund would deliver greater certainty to investors about the long-term revenues available to the industry.

Similarly, investors continue to receive returns on investments in pharmaceutical R&D. The only difference is that the most successful investments would be in the innovations which produce the most health benefit, rather than in the innovations which sell best.
