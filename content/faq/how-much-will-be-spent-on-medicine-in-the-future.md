A reasonable ballpark figure for current global expenditure on all medicines from all funding sources is 1 trillion dollars. One estimate for 2015 put the figure at $1 trillion,[^1] and another for 2016 at 1.1 trillion dollars.[^2] In 2017, 1 trillion dollars is likely to be an underestimate. Forecasts suggest that by 2020, global expenditure on medicines will rise to 1.4 trillion dollars.[^3]
