Under remuneration rights, there will be two payment streams, meaning R&D costs are remunerated separately from the sale of drugs. Most importantly, remuneration rights are allocated in proportion to health impact rather than market profitability, a new incentive is created to research medicines for conditions mainly affecting the poor. Open information and lack of market exclusivity also encourage competition in manufacture, and companies creating medicines would also have an incentive to distribute their medicines as widely as possible.
