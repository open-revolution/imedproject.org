Protecting the privacy of this information is essential and privacy will be protected – even more so than today. All data work will take place under standards and practices at least as good as today.

Collecting data to track both the use and efficacy of medicines is part of the current medical system. It will be even more important in the new system because we want the incentives to make medicines tied directly to health impact – which means we need to measure health impact. Protecting the privacy of this information is essential and privacy will be protected – even more so than today. The key point is that for the new system to work we just need information about the overall efficacy and usage of a drug – how many people in total used it and how effective it was on average. This means we don’t need to store individual patient level data. In addition, all data work will take place under standards and practices at least as good as today.
