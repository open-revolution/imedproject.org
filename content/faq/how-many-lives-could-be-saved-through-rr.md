The overall annual global mortality due to lack of access to medicines is 55.8 million, and it seems unlikely that more than a fifth of deaths are preventable through access to drugs. The number of people who die through lack of access will be less than tens of millions. Vaccine coverage alone would prevent more than a million deaths annually. Therefore ‘Millions’ rather than ‘tens of millions’ is the most plausible order of magnitude.
