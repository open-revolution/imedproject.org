# Summary

The Cancer Innovation Fund is a label for a series of proposals to demonopolise cancer treatments, and remunerate innovators instead through a fund.[^26]

Proposals to this effect have taken various forms (for more information, see below), including:

-   A fund for the EU only

-   A fund for like minded countries

-   Funding from national budgets for cancer treatments

-   Funding from national budgets for the purchase of cancer drugs

-   Funding from national budgets for healthcare

-   Rewards in proportion to health impact

Such proposals have been discussed at the WHO and in 2017 a resolution was passed which mandated a feasibility study into pricing approaches for cancer treatments.[^27]

# Notes

## Details

-   In 2008 Barbados and Bolivia made a proposal on cancer delinkage to the WHO.[^28]

-   In 2009 Bangladesh, Bolivia and Suriname made a proposal on cancer delinkage to the WHO.[^29]

-   In 2014 a proposal was discussed by actors in Europe for an EU wide cancer fund.[^30]

-   In January 2017, the WHO Executive Board discussed a proposed resolution on a cancer fund. References to delinkage were apparently removed at this point due to their controversial nature.[^31]

-   A draft resolution was proposed to the WHO in May by Brazil, Canada, Colombia, Costa Rica, France, Netherlands, Nigeria, Panama, Peru, Russia, Thailand and Zambia.[^32]

-   In May, WHO members agreed to this resolution.

## Analysis

**Scope**: The proposals focus on cancer treatments. The proposals would affect all stages of R&D in the field of cancer.

**Access**: As the proposals would delink completely, competition would increase, drug prices decrease, and access increase. If rewards were linked to health impact, this would provide a distribution incentive.

**Innovation**: Some versions of this proposal suggest explicitly linking incentives to health impact. Removing all monopoly rights would create incentives for generic competition, and if a sufficiently large remuneration fund were established, this would incentivise new research.

**Efficiency**: This would be an expensive proposal. The 2014 EU proposal suggested a fund of 15.7 billion (currency unstated, presumed dollars).[^33] The fund would be market-based, as it would create demand-side competition.

**Governability**: Such a fund would require a multinational governance structure. Little work seems to have been done in developing proposals in this area. If remuneration were based on impact, this would require complex measurement. The selection system would need to be robust against political interference.

**Political Feasibility**: The US opposed any reference to delinkage in the WHO resolutions.[^34] James Love commented that there is growing interest in Europe and the developing world for such a proposal.[^35] As it entirely does away with monopoly rights, it is unlikely to receive support from pharmaceutical companies.

## Relation to other proposals

-   Another fund that entirely does away with monopoly rights is Medical Innovation Prize Fund (MIPF). MIPF only concerns the US, unlike CIF, and affects all drugs, rather than just cancer.

-   The Health Impact Fund (HIF) and the Australian Democrats Prize Fund are comprehensive and optional versions of CIF.[^36]

-   The proposals from the WHO health R&D discussions envisage a comprehensive international fund which does not replace monopoly rights.[^37]

-   The Fund for research in Neglected Tropical Diseases (FRiND) and the PDP+ Fund fund R&D upfront rather than via remuneration, and coexist with the patenting system. Like CIF, FRiND is an international and disease specific research fund.[^38]

-   Developing Economies\' Fund for Essential New Drugs' (DEFEND) annual payments proportionate to social value and burden of disease are reminiscent of remuneration rights. The difference is that remuneration rights replace patent rights completely, while these license payments only compensate for the drug licenses in developing countries, leaving the patents in developed countries intact.

## Political strategy

-   Targeted at:

    -   Governments

    -   WHO

-   Stakeholders on board:

    -   KEI

    -   Union for Affordable Cancer Treatment (UACT)

    -   Bangladesh, Bolivia, Barbados and Suriname
