-   **Description**: A \$108 million social impact investment fund designed to provide financing to advance the development of drugs, vaccines, diagnostics and other interventions against diseases that disproportionately burden low- and middle-income countries.

-   **Start date**: Launched in 2013.

-   **Status**: Operational.

# Summary

GHIF is an impact investment fund which finances high potential impact medical R&D opportunities. In practice this means medical innovations that target diseases of the developing world. Potential losses to investors are underwritten by the Gates Foundation and the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency.[^73]

# Notes

## Analysis

**Scope**: GHIF is disease neutral, and only funds late stage development.

**Access**: GHIF has no bearing on the price or distribution of drugs.

**Innovation**: Incentives are linked to potential impact, and so are partially linked to health impact itself.

**Efficiency**: GHIF is a market-based funding mechanism, in that it is a decentralised selection procedure which is influenced by profitability on the market.

**Governability**: GHIF does not require a particularly complex governance structure. It is subject to the problem of selection.

**Political Feasibility**: GHIF is supported by a range of governments and funders, and has the potential to attract funding that would otherwise not have been available.

## Relation to other proposals

GHIF is an impact investment fund which targets medical R&D. We have not examined other examples of such a funding mechanism.
