-   **Description**: A scheme where donors precommit to subsidise the price of pneumococcal vaccines on development.

-   **Start date**: Launched in 2007.

-   **Status**: Operational.

# Summary

The AMC for pneumococcal vaccines is a pilot scheme designed to test the efficacy of Advanced Market Commitments.

In general, AMCs function through donors committing funds to guarantee the price of vaccines once they have been developed. This creates an incentive for manufacturers to invest in R&D. Companies who take up the offer of a subsidised price for their vaccine commit to sell the vaccine at an affordable price.

The pneumococcal AMC is slightly different as at the time it was launched, pneumococcal vaccines already existed. This has led some to regard it more as an Advanced Procurement Commitment, which was indeed
the name of the proposal until late in the process.[^6]

Under the pneumococcal scheme, donor countries and philanthropies make grants to the World Bank, which disburses money to an organisation called [GAVI](http://imedproject.org/research/proposals-database/GAVI/), the Vaccine Alliance. GAVI passes this money on to manufacturers who have passed the application process and have won a supply agreement.[^7]

# Notes

## Details

-   In 2005 the Center for Global Development published a report on AMCs.[^8]

-   In 2006 the G8 launched a consultative process for a pilot.

-   In 2007 a pilot was launched with Gates Foundation money.

-   In 2009 the pneumococcal vaccine AMC became operational.

-   In 2010 the first long-term manufacturing commitments were made.

-   Impact evaluation of the pneumococcal AMC suggests that:

    -   A low-income country market for vaccines was successfully created.

    -   The AMC did not accelerate R&D outcomes.

    -   Supply shortages were rectified more quickly because of the AMC.[^9]

## Analysis

**Scope**: AMCs are disease specific. The pneumococcal AMC targeted late-stage development. In theory an AMC could be run for basic research, but this has not been proven.[^10]

**Access**: The cost of the drug is reduced through AMCs. They also incentivise distribution via donors' commitments to purchase and distribute drugs.

**Innovation**: Incentives are not directly linked to health impact. AMCs could possibly reduce competition and therefore innovation.[^11] It is not clear whether the incentives offered are strong enough: in the case of the pneumococcal AMC, it seems that R&D outcomes were not accelerated.[^12]

**Efficiency**: AMCs require a large amount of funding. AMCs are not market-based.

**Governability**: AMCs require a large amount of administration. They also require narrow specification, which is difficult to do correctly. It is also hard to set the price in advance without reference to the market. The selection process is at risk from political interference.

**Political Feasibility**: AMCs are attractive to industry and to beneficiaries, as they maintain intellectual property while increasing access.

## Relation to other proposals

-   The pneumococcal vaccine AMC is one kind of AMC or Advance Purchase Commitment (APC).

-   GAVI, the vaccine alliance, manages the pneumococcal AMC.

-   The US Project BioShield, which aims to reduce the risk of bioterrorism, created a fund to be spent on vaccines and other drugs for the national stockpile. Although not a formal AMC commitment, this acts as a similar kind of incentive.[^13]

-   An AMC is a similar mechanism to a prize. Unlike most prizes, AMCs do solve the distribution problem, through donors' commitment to purchase and then distribute drugs.

    -   The Chagas Disease Prize Fund (CDPP) and Tuberculosis Prizes would also solve the distribution problem by making the prize conditional on health impact and market presence.

-   The pneumococcal AMC actually looks very like an APC because the vaccines had been developed prior to the commitment. Purchasing agreements of this sort are designed to maximise access. The opposite problem is sometimes experiences with antibiotics, were policy-makers seek to limit supply through purchase agreements to curb resistance. The WHO global consortium is an example of such a proposal.

## Political strategy

    -   GAVI

    -   UNICEF

    -   WHO

    -   CGD

    -   Gates Foundation

    -   G8
