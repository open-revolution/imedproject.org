-   [[Full proposal]{.underline}](http://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc805930/)

-   **Description**: A set of incentives included extended market exclusivity introduced by government to encourage the creation of drugs which affect a small number of people.

-   **Start date**: Enacted in 1983.

-   **Status**: Operational.

# Summary

The US Orphan Drugs Act of 1983 created a premium pricing model for drugs with a small market. Specifically it targeted rare diseases affecting fewer than 200,000 people.[^133]

To incentivise drugs companies to develop drugs for such diseases, the ODA offers companies extended exclusivity on any such drugs created, on the condition that the drugs are of sufficient quantity and quality. Companies are also granted tax credits in exchange for developing such drugs.

# Notes

## Details

Before 1983, only 10 orphan drugs were made. From then until 2014, over 200 were developed.[^134]

## Analysis

**Scope**: The ODA targets only diseases which affect a small number of people. This obviously limits its potential health impact. It applies to America, and affects the licensing of drugs (rather than directly funding research).

**Access**: The ODA functions to increase the price of drugs because it extends market exclusivity. There is a provision in the act that a sufficient quantity of an orphan drug must be produced, and beyond this there is no distribution incentive.

**Innovation**: Incentives are not linked to health impact.

**Efficiency**: The ODA is not a particularly costly scheme to create or administer. It requires the drugs covered to be defined, but other than this no in depth measurement. It is not market-based.

**Governability**: The ODA is administered by the FDA.

**Political Feasibility**: ODAs have been successfully implemented in the USA and elsewhere. Pharmaceutical companies are supportive.

## Relation to other proposals

-   Other ODAs have been implemented by the EU, Japan, Australia and Singapore.[^135]

-   The ODA includes tax credits. The Vaccines Research Relief programme in the UK also offered tax credits on R&D expenditure towards vaccines in neglected areas.[^136]

-   The ODA primarily functions through extended market exclusivity. Another way of using market exclusivity to incentivise particular behaviours is Transferable Intellectual Property Rights (TIPR), where exclusivity is granted on a drug of choice in exchange for the creation of a neglected drug.

-   In 1997, under the Modernisation Act, the US introduced the Paediatric incentive scheme. This is very similar to ODA: it grants market exclusivity on drugs for adult consumption in exchange for trailing the drug on children. Rather than incentivising the creation of drugs, the paediatric incentive actually functions to incentivise drugs trials.[^137]

## Political strategy

-   Targeted at:

    -   Pharmaceutical companies

-   Stakeholders on board:

    -   The US government

    -   The FDA

    -   Pharmaceutical companies
