<h2>Money flow under the current system</h2>
Money only moves through the current system in one way: via the sale of drugs. Because of this, pharmaceutical companies are awarded patent monopolies on their innovations, which allow them to control access to the drug and set its price. As this stream must be used to finance both the costs of drug manufacture, which are low, and medical innovation, which are high, the overall prices of drugs are high. Given their high price tag, only the wealthy are able to access them, despite the physical product being relatively cheap.
